# web-bot
hosts my Devpost web bot application:

web-bot, also known as PROJECT MERCURY, is a desktop applicaiton that is meant to help 
younger users make financial decisions in the stock market. Due to the increase in youth 
investments made easy through platforms like Robinhood, many young investors are starting 
to take on the stock market. However, if dealt with irresponsibly, trading on the market 
can cause users to lose their savings. 

Therefore, PROJECT MERCURY is here to help investors visualize their individualized stock 
portfolio by signing into their Yahoo Finance account, retrieving current market data, and 
allowing users to visualize that data to notice trends and see what stocks they can afford.
